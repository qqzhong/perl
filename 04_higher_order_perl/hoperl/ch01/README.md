# Chapter 1: Recursion and Callbacks

We begin the path to Higher-Order Perl with one of the first things we usually cover in a functional programming course; the concept of recursion.  The author takes us into this world gradually, first discussing fibonacci numbers, then illustrating an example with the towers of Hanoi.  I found myself at times anxious to jump into the next part of the chapter, but I understood that this was originally meant for someone coming into FP and HOP for the first time.

However, we soon got into more meaty examples with assignments about traversing an entire directory tree, looking into parsing some HTML, and the concept of partitioning.  This reminded me of another assignment I once had to crack: one of the problems from the https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/problems site, where we had to optimize prices for a factory.  This idea kept me hooked on the material, as the author promised to serve up a 'cleaner' solution later down the road.
