#Chapter 7: Higher Order Functions and Currying

Chapter 7 of HOP has to do with Currying, and will take from previous examples and see how best we can change them, 'turning an ordinary function into a factory that manufactures functions on demand'.  We not only take a look at functions that we've written before, but functions such as map() or grep().  Parts of Perl syntax that we leverage in this chapter include function prototyping, in several examples.  We also go back to querying database files, making OR and AND queries simpler to write in the code.
