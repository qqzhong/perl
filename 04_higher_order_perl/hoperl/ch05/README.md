#Chapter 5: Moving from Recursion to Iterators

In this chapter we still focus on the Iterator class, using what we learned in Chapter 4, but take some of our older code and switch it over from recursion.  We start with the partition problem again, and then move on to palidromes, building a tree in each case to find the possible solution in a space of so many options.  We explore depth first search (DFS) and look at tail-call elimination for removing recursion as well.

We also look at powersets, and binary/factorial maths to round out the rest of the chapter.  We then focus on relentlessly taking out recursion from the fibonacci sequence, using stacks and tail-call, which brings us to Chapter 6: Streams.
