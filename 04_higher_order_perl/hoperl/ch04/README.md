#Chapter 4: Iterators

This contains the beginnings of a Perl module to hold integral parts of iteration, which a lot of the code examples will use in this chapter and a few of the successive chapters.

Note that rand1 and 'make rand' are both random number generators, but rand1 will always spit out the same sequence of numbers, whereas the iterator used in 'make rand' will generate a different set of numbers each time.
