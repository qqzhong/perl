# Chapter 3: Caching and Memoization

Starting with this chapter we start to go over algorithms for performance.  One of the ways that we start to make things faster is to Cache, but another way is to Memoize the function.

The author shows some very useful examples here, including writing our own memoize function, and includes topics as diverse as permenant key stores, scoping, and possible alternatives to memoization.
