# Chapter 8: Parsing

In this chapter we focus on Parsers and Lexers, and how they go together.  Eventually we get to parsing and overloading in Chapter 8.9, for which we set aside a separate folder, since it involved overwriting a lot of the existing code.

Topics include: Lexers, syntactic sugar, emulation of a calculator, grammars and their diagrams, recursive-descent parsers, and generic-operator parsers.
