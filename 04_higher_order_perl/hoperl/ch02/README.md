#Chapter 2: Dispatch Tables

While there is not a lot of code in this chpater, we cover something here that is important: the idea of creating a hash, or dispatch table, which will then reach out to different functions in the code.  This is introduced now, but used quite a bit later (Please check out Parsers in Chapter 8 and 9 as examples), in a number of places.

I worked on two of the example here in this chapter: HTML parsing and reverse Polish notation.  Overall, the tables were not very complex in this chapter (usually a base case and a function for handling certain tags, etc.) but could be expanded upon easily.
